## TS-20 SAE Data App

Running at: http://ts20.billydasdev.com/

This project aims to solve the issues which Team Swinburne faces in gathering, storing, analysing and displaying onboard data for the Formula SAE team. At present, the system in place only allows for data to be gathered after a test or race session is complete. This restricts the teamâ€™s ability to both find faults within and make adjustments to the car in a timely manner. This project aims to create an onboard solution which gathers, stores, and displays the aforementioned data in real-time, so it can be accessed simply, reliably, and efficiently.
