# DummyDataGen

DummyDataGen generates SQL statements to populate our database tables with dummy data.

## Usage

Run:

```bash
python dummygen.py
```

`output.txt` and `output2.txt` will be produced.

## To-Do

- This looks like something a 3rd grader could've written, I need to fix it so it's actually modifiable and readable...
- Actually insert to the database instead of just generating `.txt` files.
